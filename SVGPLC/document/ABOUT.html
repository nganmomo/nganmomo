      <h2>Modular design</h2>
      <p>The ESP32 S3 MCU stands as a potent testament to the transformative power of modern microcontroller units (MCUs). With its comprehensive array of functions and pivotal system-on-chip architecture, the ESP32 S3 emerges as an exemplary choice, balancing cost-effectiveness with robust performance.</p>
      <p>At its core, the ESP32 S3 harnesses a remarkable blend of capabilities. Its intrinsic wireless communication capabilities coupled with a built-in HTTP server exemplify its versatility and utility. Moreover, the generous allocation of memory further enhances its capacity to handle complex tasks and data-intensive applications.</p>
      <p>In our endeavor, the adoption of the ESP32 S3 MCU has proven instrumental, particularly within our PLC systems. By seamlessly integrating this MCU, we've unlocked a spectrum of functionalities ranging from facilitating human-machine interaction to enabling seamless network communication protocols.</p>
      <p>The ESP32 S3's prowess extends beyond its technical specifications; it embodies a paradigm shift in the realm of embedded systems, empowering developers and engineers to realize innovative solutions at a fraction of traditional costs. Its amalgamation of affordability and performance sets a new standard within the industry, driving progress and innovation in diverse domains.</p>
      <p>In summary, the ESP32 S3 MCU represents more than just a component; it symbolizes the convergence of cutting-edge technology and practical application, underscoring its pivotal role in shaping the future of embedded systems and IoT devices alike.</p>

      <h2>Software structure</h2>
      <img src="../images/SoftwareBox.png">      
      <p>As shown in the picture above, editing PLC programs can be done through an online website or a small server in esp32. The online server will be updated regularly. If the user updates the ESP32 firmware, both sides are basically the same.</p>
      <p>To save costs, We used existing hardware on the market and designed only the necessary parts. Software and firmware downloads and support available. Users can create their own projects and select their parts.</p>

      <h2>Communication protocol</h2>
      <p>When establishing connections between modules, the choice of communication protocols plays a pivotal role in ensuring reliable data transmission. For short-distance communication, RS232 emerges as a dependable option, offering stable connectivity within close proximity. Conversely, for longer distances and environments prone to electrical noise, RS485 stands out as the preferred solution, characterized by its robustness and extended range capabilities.</p>
      <p>In our configuration, the connection between the PLC system and the data acquisition computer transcends conventional paradigms. Leveraging the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol, we've embraced a modern and efficient approach to data exchange and synchronization.</p>
      <p>The MQTT protocol's lightweight nature and efficient publish-subscribe architecture make it an ideal choice for our needs. By facilitating seamless communication between disparate devices and systems, MQTT transcends the constraints of traditional point-to-point connections, fostering a dynamic ecosystem of data sharing and collaboration.</p>
      <p>In essence, by adopting the MQTT protocol, we've transcended the limitations of conventional communication paradigms, ushering in an era of interconnectedness and interoperability. This strategic decision not only enhances the efficiency of our systems but also lays the foundation for scalable and future-proof solutions in the ever-evolving landscape of industrial automation and data acquisition.</p>      
      <p>RS232 for short distance communication, or RS485 for long distance communication. Mqtt or Ethernet can also be used depending on the situation.</p>
      <p>Simple open format that can be converted to any standard such as modbus. This PLC is basically designed for small systems.</p>
      <p>API software templates will be provided</p>
