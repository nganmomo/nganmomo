  <h2>About this project</h2> 
  <p>The project was designed using the latest technology tools such as libraries Nodejs, System-on-Chip MCU and Web App etc. The hardware can be connected with third party devices and common standards such as MQTT and Modbus. This reduces costs and shortens time to market. On the software side, the web application is cross-platform and requires no installation. Since the memory stored by the MCU is large, it can even support multiple html pages, just like a small server. It creates a web application that can run without a network.</p>
  <br><h2>Developing Programs with Donkey Builder</h2>
  <p>Easy Ladder Logic Generator is a newly designed web application for 2024. It is by far the most advanced, powerful, intuitive, easy-to-use and flexible graphical program development package on the automation market. It is very easy to learn yet provides the ability to complete complex program operations with ease. It improves programmer productivity, program reliability, documentation, and supports the development of reusable program components. PLC software technology takes a generational leap with the introduction of the Easy Ladder logic generator.</p>
  <br><p>Easy Ladder Logic also provides combined language programming and mixed C++. You can use C++ to call function blocks or ladder diagrams to call C++, etc., and cooperate with multi-MCU designs to realize interfaces with most external devices.</p>
  <br><p>8 special input/output groups, each group contains 4 pins, controlled by independent MCU, used to control stepper motors or servo control, SPI and Uart devices, etc.</p>
     
  <p>As shown in the picture above, editing PLC programs can be done through an online website or a small server in esp32. The online server will be updated regularly. If the user updates the ESP32 firmware, both sides are basically the same.</p>
  <p>To save costs, We used existing hardware on the market and designed only the necessary parts. Software and firmware downloads and support available. Users can create their own projects and select their parts.</p>

      <h2>Communication protocol</h2>
      <p>When establishing connections between modules, the choice of communication protocols plays a pivotal role in ensuring reliable data transmission. For short-distance communication, RS232 emerges as a dependable option, offering stable connectivity within close proximity. Conversely, for longer distances and environments prone to electrical noise, RS485 stands out as the preferred solution, characterized by its robustness and extended range capabilities.</p>
      <p>In our configuration, the connection between the PLC system and the data acquisition computer transcends conventional paradigms. Leveraging the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol, we've embraced a modern and efficient approach to data exchange and synchronization.</p>
      <p>The MQTT protocol's lightweight nature and efficient publish-subscribe architecture make it an ideal choice for our needs. By facilitating seamless communication between disparate devices and systems, MQTT transcends the constraints of traditional point-to-point connections, fostering a dynamic ecosystem of data sharing and collaboration.</p>
      <p>In essence, by adopting the MQTT protocol, we've transcended the limitations of conventional communication paradigms, ushering in an era of interconnectedness and interoperability. This strategic decision not only enhances the efficiency of our systems but also lays the foundation for scalable and future-proof solutions in the ever-evolving landscape of industrial automation and data acquisition.</p>      
      <p>RS232 for short distance communication, or RS485 for long distance communication. Mqtt or Ethernet can also be used depending on the situation.</p>
      <p>Simple open format that can be converted to any standard such as modbus. This PLC is basically designed for small systems.</p>
      <p>API software templates will be provided</p>
