      <h2>Application overview</h2>
      <p>Consider this a simplest programmable logic control with powerful functionality since the MCU has system and wifi on chip.</p>     
      <p>The chip provides a very good Web application environment and intuitive human-machine interface. Compared with equipment with the same function, the cost of PLC is greatly reduced.</p>
      <p>Also, the development environment has evolved over several generations, so it's a right to redevelopment.</p>             
      <p>This PLC design is basically open source code and schematics. However, some software does not belong to us and cannot be made available to the original designers.</p>

      <h2>System hardware configuration</h2>
      <p>The mainboard is mainly composed of two MCUs, one for the main program and the other for the local Mqtt broker. If Local Mqtt is not required, the second MCU will be unloaded.</p>     
      <p>To increase feasibility, the input and output devices are mounted on another module, so the user can configure any combination as required.</p>
      <p>There are many ways to connect the motherboard to the input/output modules, including RS232, RS485 and Mqtt. xhttp etc.</p>                  
      <p>The system looks complex, however, everything is ready to use and the system can be set up very quickly.</p>
